# Persian Spoken Dialogue System
ðŸ”¥ In this repo we fine-tuned 3 parts of this model to achive a rich SDS for Persian language ðŸ”¥ :
1. Automatic Speech Recognition : Convert speech to text : Whisper model is fine-tuned
2. Large Language Model : Generate the answer : LLAMA-3-8b-instruct, Gemma2, Mistral are fine-tuned using adaptor
3. Text To Speech : Convert textual answer to speech : speecht5 model is fine-tuned

We have also implemented this work using gradio in jupyter note book which you can run it in colab.
